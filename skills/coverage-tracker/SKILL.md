# Coverage Tracker - Skill Coverage Verification

A tool skill for verifying that all required skills from a job description are present and demonstrated in a resume.

## Overview

Coverage tracker is a safety mechanism that ensures resume optimization never sacrifices required skills. It maintains a coverage matrix mapping which resume experiences demonstrate which job requirements.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check coverage | `check_coverage.py --resume resume.docx --requirements jd.json` |
| Verify no loss | `verify_unchanged.py --before v1.json --after v2.json` |
| Find gaps | `find_gaps.py --resume resume.docx --requirements jd.json` |
| Map skills | `map_skills.py --resume resume.docx --requirements jd.json` |

## Core Concepts

### Coverage Matrix

Maps which resume experiences demonstrate which required skills:

```json
{
  "skill_coverage": {
    "Python": {
      "required": true,
      "covered": true,
      "importance": 10,
      "evidence": [
        {
          "bullet_id": "bullet_001",
          "text": "Built recommendation system using Python...",
          "relevance": 0.95
        },
        {
          "bullet_id": "bullet_005",
          "text": "Automated data pipeline with Python scripts...",
          "relevance": 0.87
        }
      ],
      "coverage_strength": "strong"
    },
    "Kubernetes": {
      "required": true,
      "covered": false,
      "importance": 8,
      "evidence": [],
      "coverage_strength": "none"
    }
  },
  "overall_coverage": 0.85,
  "must_have_coverage": 0.75,
  "nice_to_have_coverage": 0.95
}
```

### Coverage Strength Levels

- **strong**: 3+ pieces of evidence with high relevance
- **moderate**: 2 pieces of evidence
- **weak**: 1 piece of evidence
- **none**: 0 pieces of evidence (gap!)

## Core Operations

### Check Coverage

Verify all required skills are present:

```bash
python scripts/check_coverage.py --resume resume.docx --requirements jd_analyzed.json
```

**Input format for requirements** (from ats-analyzer):
```json
{
  "required_skills": [
    {
      "skill": "Python",
      "category": "must_have",
      "importance": 10
    },
    {
      "skill": "Tableau",
      "category": "nice_to_have",
      "importance": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "coverage_percentage": 0.85,
  "must_have_coverage": 0.75,
  "nice_to_have_coverage": 0.95,
  "total_required": 20,
  "total_covered": 17,
  "status": "incomplete",
  "missing_skills": ["Kubernetes", "Docker", "Terraform"]
}
```

### Verify No Loss During Compression

Ensure compression didn't lose any required skills:

```bash
python scripts/verify_unchanged.py --before coverage_v1.json --after coverage_v2.json
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "coverage_maintained": true,
  "skills_lost": [],
  "skills_weakened": ["SQL"],
  "details": {
    "SQL": {
      "before_evidence_count": 3,
      "after_evidence_count": 2,
      "still_covered": true,
      "strength_change": "strong → moderate"
    }
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL**: If `coverage_maintained` is `false`, compression must be rolled back!

### Find Gaps

Identify missing required skills:

```bash
python scripts/find_gaps.py --resume resume.docx --requirements jd_analyzed.json
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "gaps": [
    {
      "skill": "Kubernetes",
      "category": "must_have",
      "importance": 8,
      "severity": "critical",
      "suggestions": [
        "Check if Docker experience can be mentioned",
        "Look for container orchestration projects",
        "Consider if coursework covered this"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "prompt_for_user": "This role requires Kubernetes (must-have). Do you have any container orchestration or Kubernetes experience we haven't captured?"
}
```

### Map Skills to Experiences

Create detailed mapping of which experiences demonstrate which skills:

```bash
python scripts/map_skills.py --resume resume.docx --requirements jd_analyzed.json
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "skill_map": {
    "Python": {
      "exp_001": {
        "company": "Tech Corp",
        "bullets": ["bullet_001", "bullet_003"],
        "relevance": 0.92
      },
      "exp_002": {
        "company": "Data Inc",
        "bullets": ["bullet_007"],
        "relevance": 0.85
      }
    }
  },
  "experience_priority": [
    {
      "exp_id": "exp_001",
      "skills_covered": ["Python", "ML", "A/B Testing"],
      "must_have_count": 3,
      "relevance_score": 9.5,
      "must_include": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with rescume Workflow

### Initial Coverage Check (After JD Analysis)

```bash
# 1. ATS analyzer creates jd_analyzed.json
# 2. Check initial coverage
python scripts/check_coverage.py --resume current_resume.docx --requirements jd_analyzed.json

# Output: 85% coverage, missing Kubernetes
```

### Gap Filling Loop

```bash
# 3. Find gaps
python scripts/find_gaps.py --resume current_resume.docx --requirements jd_analyzed.json

# 4. Interview conductor asks user about Kubernetes
# 5. User provides Docker experience
# 6. Database updated

# 7. Re-check coverage
python scripts/check_coverage.py --resume updated_resume.docx --requirements jd_analyzed.json

# Output: 100% coverage ✓
```

### Compression Safety Check

```bash
# Before compression iteration
python scripts/check_coverage.py --resume draft_v1.docx --requirements jd_analyzed.json > coverage_v1.json

# Compression happens
compression-strategist compresses draft_v1.docx → draft_v2.docx

# After compression
python scripts/check_coverage.py --resume draft_v2.docx --requirements jd_analyzed.json > coverage_v2.json

# Verify no loss
python scripts/verify_unchanged.py --before coverage_v1.json --after coverage_v2.json

# Result: coverage_maintained = true ✓ (safe to continue)
# OR: coverage_maintained = false ✗ (ROLLBACK!)
```

## Python Script Reference

### check_coverage.py

Check overall skill coverage.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/check_coverage.py --resume <docx> --requirements <json>
```

- `--resume`: Path to resume DOCX file
- `--requirements`: Path to JD requirements JSON (from ats-analyzer)

**Returns:** JSON with coverage metrics

### verify_unchanged.py

Verify coverage hasn't degraded.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/verify_unchanged.py --before <json> --after <json>
```

**Parameters:**
- `--before`: Coverage before compression
- `--after`: Coverage after compression

**Returns:** JSON indicating if coverage maintained

**Exit codes:**
- `0`: Coverage maintained ✓
- `1`: Coverage lost ✗ (CRITICAL!)

### find_gaps.py

```

**Parameters:**
- `--resume`: Path to resume DOCX
- `--requirements`: Path to JD requirements JSON

**Returns:** JSON with detailed skill-to-experience mapping

## Skill Matching Algorithm

The coverage tracker uses fuzzy matching to detect skills in resume text:

### Exact Match
- "Python" in requirements → finds "Python" in resume ✓

### Synonym Match
- "ML" in requirements → finds "Machine Learning" in resume ✓
- "A/B Testing" → finds "experimentation" ✓

### Abbreviation Expansion
- "SQL" → finds "Structured Query Language" ✓

### Technology Families
- "AWS" → finds "Amazon Web Services", "S3", "EC2" ✓
- "React" → finds "React.js", "ReactJS" ✓

## Coverage Rules

### Must-Have Skills
- **Required**: 100% coverage
- **Action if missing**: Trigger interview-conductor to fill gap
- **Compression rule**: NEVER remove last evidence of must-have skill

### Nice-to-Have Skills
- **Target**: 80%+ coverage
- **Action if missing**: Note in coverage report, but not critical
- **Compression rule**: Can remove if necessary for space

## Integration with compression-strategist

The compression-strategist uses this skill as a safety check:

```python
# Compression agent workflow
def compress(resume, requirements):
    # 1. Check baseline coverage
    baseline_coverage = check_coverage(resume, requirements)
    
    # 2. Apply compression
    compressed_resume = apply_compression_rules(resume)
    
    # 3. Verify coverage maintained
    new_coverage = check_coverage(compressed_resume, requirements)
    
    # 4. Safety check
    coverage_ok = verify_unchanged(baseline_coverage, new_coverage)
    
    if not coverage_ok:
        # ROLLBACK! Compression lost required skill
        return {"status": "cannot_compress", "reason": "Would lose required skill"}
    
    return {"status": "success", "compressed_resume": compressed_resume}
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### Hard Constraints
1. **Never compress below 100% must-have coverage**
2. **Never remove last evidence of required skill**
3. **Flag if coverage strength drops below "weak"**

### Warning Signals
- Coverage percentage drops > 5%
- Must-have skill has only 1 piece of evidence remaining
- Nice-to-have coverage drops below 70%

## Best Practices

1. **Check coverage before every compression iteration**
2. **Use verify_unchanged.py as gate before accepting compressed version**
3. **Map skills early** to identify high-priority experiences
4. **Never skip gap filling** - always get to 100% coverage before content generation
5. **Keep evidence diverse** - don't rely on single experience for multiple skills

## Error Handling

All scripts return proper exit codes:
- `0`: Success, coverage OK
- `1`: Coverage lost or incomplete
- `2`: File not found
- `3`: Invalid requirements format

Critical checks (verify_unchanged.py):
```bash
if ! python scripts/verify_unchanged.py --before coverage_v1.json --after coverage_v2.json; then
    echo "CRITICAL: Coverage lost during compression!"
    # Rollback to previous version
    cp draft_v1.docx draft_v2.docx
fi
```

## Notes

- Coverage tracking uses DOCX text content, not structured database
- Skills are case-insensitive matched
- Fuzzy matching allows ~10% character differences
- Re-run coverage check after any resume edits
- Coverage matrix saved alongside resume for audit trail
